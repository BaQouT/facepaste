facepaste is a Firefox addon that downloads Facebook albums. Many addons of this
kind have been written in the past, but have been left unmaintained and are now
broken due to Facebook's frequent site changes.

Currently, although it works, facepaste is extremely spartan. It has no real
interface to speak of, interacting with the user entirely with JavaScript
alert() and confirm() calls, and directly invokes the default file downloading
action, which is unfriendly as it requires the user to use the global setting
"Options > Downloads > Save files to" to control the output directory. Worse,
if a user currently happens to have "Always ask me where to save files"
selected, the user will be bombarded with a "save as" window for each photo.

It uses a global function, saveURL, to initiate file downloads, which I
stumbled upon when reading the source of an older, now broken downloader addon.
This function, however, appears to be completely undocumented.

Future commits will see this addon be completely rewritten with a proper
interface, and more flexible downloading behaviour; stay tuned.
